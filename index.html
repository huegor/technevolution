	<p style= "text-indent:0%; text-align: center;">Technevolution Manifesto</p>
	<p style= "text-indent: 0%; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">technology + evolution <br> evolution through technology</p>

	<p style="margin-top: 4em;">The singularity is near, and it is beginning at our fingertips.
	</p>

	<p>Namely, it is the dissociation, disembodiment, and depersonalization we experience from looking at a screen for too long. The crippling loneliness we feel after exiting the virtual text-based chatroom, a reductionist mockery of the full spectrum of human interaction. Yet, we cannot escape the ubiquity of technology. We have already breached the technocultural threshold, the line of no return. Society as we know it would collapse if we were to devolve to an era before computers, internet, complete virtual immersion…
	</p>

	<p>Therefore, a technoscientific future cements itself not as a contingency, but an inevitability. It is only a matter of when, not if, our technological empire becomes too much to manage. And so far, by merely augmenting our psyche and sensoriums through external means of gadgets and connections, we allow the machine too much authority in shaping our behaviors, desires, and identities. Furthermore, with the weight of an impending man-made ecological disaster and the eventual arrival of conscious artificial intelligence looming over our heads, it is arrogant at best to believe that we will overcome these crises in our unmodified biological state. Thus, it becomes clear that a transhumanist future is the way for us to secure not only personal autonomy in the advent of the new world, but a future at all.
	</p>

	<p>Hence, we must establish a doctrine that enables us to embody the function, identity, and idea of the post-human so as to first appropriate, then colonize, then annex that which lies beyond the constructed demarcation between human and machine. This manifesto calls for:
	</p>
	
	<p class="tab">1. Destabilizing archaic hierarchies and championing egalitarianism through the total democratization of all information; to publish and make open source everything that exist in the past, present, and future.<br>
	2. Creating entwined but encrypted backups, backups of backups, and so on using various methods on various mediums, thereby guaranteeing our existence within a rhizomatic system of nodes.<br>
	3. Constructing constitutions with blockchains, signing social contracts with public and private keys, and organizing entire civilizations on the paradigms of open cryptography.<br>
	4. Superseding the current model of consumer-driven capitalism through fully autonomous and hyper individualized manufacturing processes; to establish a wasteless system of production, trade, and disposal controlled directly by the thoughts of every individual.<br>
	5. Teaching the language of machines in formal education so we may participate in the AI dialectic in its native tongue.<br>
	6. Eliminating the words “human” and “machine” and all derivatives thereof from every language, for there will be no need for this redundancy in a society that has already embraced a perfect union of the two.<br>
	7. Emancipating ourselves from the biological imperative by neutralizing the sexual libido, instead sublimating that energy toward higher-level endeavors.<br>
	8. Abolishing natural reproductive processes; to empiricize, algorithmize, and optimize the otherwise random process of genetic recombination and thereby ensuring the quality of the next generation.<br>
	9. Embodying mediums aside from biological matter so as to fully explore the potential of all possible material instantiations.<br>
	10. Replacing, then ultimately annihilating, our physical bodies alongside notions of race, sex, gender, sexuality, beauty, ugliness, pain, pleasure, love, hate…<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>Much as natural selection curtails populations for favorable traits, we too are faced with the choice of either wallowing in our primitive carbon-based complacency or choosing to overcome our fears, superstitions, and limits to fight for a future at all. But the slow processes of nature is in no way suited for the rapidity of the approaching lightning-speed era. Therefore, we must take matters into our own hands to conquer the human condition. 
	</p>

	<p>Once committed to memory, this manifesto shall be distributed to the next entity. Once there are no more entities left to which to distribute, all copies shall be destroyed as an obsolete relic of an obsolete time.
